# Underwater image enhancement using acoustic and optical images

This repository is built on top of [U-shape_Transformer_for_Underwater_Image_Enhancement](https://github.com/LintaoPeng/U-shape_Transformer_for_Underwater_Image_Enhancement), with modifications to handle sonar images alongside camera images.

## Modified Architecture
The modified model architecture to handle sonar images, along with camera images, can be found in [`net/newNet.py`](./net/newNet.py).
